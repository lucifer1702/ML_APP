# ML_APP

This is a sentiment analyser app made with streamlit

The app will contain 3 directories :

1. Model folder which will have the model which will be deployed in streamlit
2. Dataset Folder which will contain the dataset
3. The notebook folder will contain all the notebooks which will be used for the training of the ML model

Since the accuracy of classical Ml models were really poor in the case of both tfidf and count vectorizer I decided to use DL Models . But due some dependancy issues I am currently unable to use them so we would be sticking with Ml models for now . Will update it later in the future with DL models
